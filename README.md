***You need to install Java,for program to run***

This program came up as a solution to a problem
i had to deal with at a small hotel i used to work,

Type of Rooms and Number of Beds had been changing almost
every day,Front Office had a big difficulty to track down the changes.
Trying to find a more permanent solution than notes and papers here and 
there ; i came up with the idea of this little Java Project,
